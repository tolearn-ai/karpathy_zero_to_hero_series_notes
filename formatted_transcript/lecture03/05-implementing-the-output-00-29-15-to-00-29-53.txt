finally let's create the final layer here so let's create w2 and b2 the input
now is 100 and the output number of neurons will be for us 27 because we have
27 possible characters that come next so the biases will be 27 as well so
therefore the logits which are the outputs of this neural net are going to be H
multiplied by W2 plus B2. Logits.shape is 32 by 27 and the logits look good.
