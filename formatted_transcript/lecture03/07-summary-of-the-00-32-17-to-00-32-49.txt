why I rewrote everything here and made it a bit more respectable. So here's our
data set, here's all the parameters that we defined, I'm now using a generator
to make it reproducible. I clustered all the parameters into a single list of
parameters so that, for example, it's easy to count them and see that in total
we currently have about 3,400 parameters. This is the forward pass as we
developed it, and we arrived at a single number here, the loss, that is
currently expressing how well this neural network works with the current
setting of parameters. Now,
